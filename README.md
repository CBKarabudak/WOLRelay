# WOLRelay
A Wake-on-LAN relaying software written in Python.

I don't like leaving my desktop on 24/7 because it's bad for the environment, could worsen the already damaged hardware, power bill etc. But I also _love_ streaming games to my tiny little Chromebook sitting on my bed. So, figured I'd make my own solution. When I have more time and learn more about Android/Python development, I will turn this into a remote control for my desktop. One click, it's on. Another, it's off.

To use the software, download the source file, change the global variables and find a way to keep the app running across reboots.
